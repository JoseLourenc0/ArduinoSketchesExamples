Arduino Sketches using the arduino bluetooth module HC-06 (SLAVE), SERVO MOTOR SG90 and HC-SR04 Ultrasonic sensor (Lib Ultrasonic.h included in Ultrasonic-master.zip).
COMMUNICATION-HC-06: Ultrasonic Sensor reads the container's level (in that project it'll be used to measure alcohol level, which in that case just for example, it's been used 30cm for a container) and send to the bluetooth module (HC-06), which send to a smartphone connected to the module to be readen for someone (App indicated: BlueCore Tech Serial Monitor-Arduino).
